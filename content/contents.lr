The UAH AMS/NWA is the University of Alabama in Huntsville chapter of the American Meteorological Society and the National Weather Association.
We are a student-led organization aiming to enrich the academic experience of our members through education, professional development, outreach, and social events.

UAH, initially an aerospace- and engineering-focused university founded during the Apollo lunar program, has grown into a dominant fixture of the eponymous "Rocket City" in north Alabama that it calls home, and is co-located with the fourth largest research park in the world.
Students have the opportunity to conduct research with top scientists from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and NOAA/NWS Forecast Office, as both they are the department are located in the National Space Science and Technology Center on campus.
The department offers a B.S. in earth system science with 7 specialty tracks, and highly regarded M.S. and Ph.D. programs in atmospheric science and earth system science.

Our chapter is home to a diverse variety of members from all around the world, and counts students specializing in areas ranging from meteorology, climate change and atmospheric chemistry to aerospace and civil engineering among its number.
Whatever your interest in the atmosphere and whatever you're looking to get out of a student organization, the UAH AMS/NWA offers something for everyone, so check us out!
